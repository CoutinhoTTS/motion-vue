The `AnimatePresence` component enables you to animate components as they enter and exit the Vue tree when controlled by `v-if` or `v-show` directives.

## Import

```ts
import { AnimatePresence } from 'motion-v'
```

## Usage

<ComponentPreview name="exit" />

## Multiple

<ComponentPreview name="multiple" />

## Integration with Radix

`AnimatePresence` can be seamlessly integrated with Radix Vue components. The following example demonstrates how to add enter and exit animations to a Radix Dialog:

<ComponentPreview name="radix-dialog" />

## Props

### `multiple`

- Default: `false`

`AnimatePresence` is based on `TransitionGroup` and `Transition`, when `multiple` is `true`, it will use `TransitionGroup` to animate multiple children.

### `mode`

- Default: `sync`

Decides how AnimatePresence handles entering and exiting children.

- `sync`: Children animate in/out as soon as they're added/removed.
- `wait`: The entering child will wait until the exiting child has animated out.
::alert{type="info" icon="lucide:info"}
  Note: Currently only render a single child at a time.
::
- `popLayout`: Exiting children will be "popped" out of the page layout. This allows surrounding elements to move to their new layout immediately.

<ComponentPreview name="pop-layout" />

### `unwrapElement`

- Default: `false`

When `true`, `AnimatePresence` will use the first child element as the transition target instead of the wrapper element. This is useful when working with components like Radix UI's PopoverContent that render an additional wrapper element.

<ComponentPreview name="unwrap-element" />
