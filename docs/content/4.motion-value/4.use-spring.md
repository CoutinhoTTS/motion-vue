`useSpring` creates a [motion value](/motion-value/overview) that will animate to its latest target with a spring animation.

The target can either be set manually via `.set`, or automatically by passing in another motion value.

<ComponentPreview name="use-spring" />

## Usage

Import `useSpring` from Motion Vue:

```ts
import { useSpring } from 'motion-v'
```

### Direct control

useSpring can be created with a number, or a unit-type (px, % etc) string:

```ts
const x = useSpring(0)
const y = useSpring('100vh')
```

Now, whenever this motion value is updated via `set()`, the value will animate to its new target with the defined spring.

```ts
x.set(100)
y.set('50vh')
```

It's also possible to update this value immediately, without a spring, with [the `jump()` method](/motion-value/overview#jump).

```ts
x.jump(50)
y.jump('0vh')
```

### Track another motion value

Its also possible to automatically spring towards the latest value of another motion value:

```ts
const x = useMotionValue(0)
const y = useSpring(x)
```

This source motion value must also be a number, or unit-type string.

## Options

The spring can be configured with a number of options. For whole reference, refer to [motion's docs](https://motion.dev/docs/spring#options).

```ts
useSpring(0, {
  stiffness: 300,
  damping: 100,
  mass: 10,
})
```

### `damping`

**Default:** `10`

Strength of opposing force. If set to 0, spring will oscillate indefinitely.

### `mass`

**Default:** `1`

Mass of the moving object. Higher values will result in more lethargic movement.

### `stiffness`

**Default:** `1`

Stiffness of the spring. Higher values will create more sudden movement.
