`useTime` returns a motion value that updates once per frame with the duration, in milliseconds, since it was first created.

This is especially useful in generating perpetual animations.

::stack
  ```ts
  const time = useTime()
  const rotate = useTransform(time, [0, 4000], [0, 360], { clamp: false })
  ```

  ```vue
  <Motion :style="{ rotate }" />
  ```

## Usage

```ts
import { useTime } from 'motion-v'
```

When called, useTime will create a new motion value. This value will update every frame with the time since its creation.

You can use this either directly or by composing with other motion value hooks.

```ts
const time = useTime()
const rotate = useTransform(time, [0, 4000], [0, 360], { clamp: false })
```
